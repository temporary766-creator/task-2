    "## ðŸŽ¤ Interview Questions & Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What is the purpose of EDA?**  \n",
    "EDA helps us understand the dataset by summarizing its key characteristics, spotting missing values, detecting anomalies, and identifying patterns that can guide feature engineering and model building.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. How do boxplots help in understanding a dataset?**  \n",
    "Boxplots show the data distribution, median, quartiles, and outliers. They are useful for detecting skewness and extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What is correlation and why is it useful?**  \n",
    "Correlation measures the relationship between two variables. It is useful in identifying redundant features (high correlation) or strong predictors of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. How do you detect skewness in data?**  \n",
    "By checking histograms, calculating skewness values, or observing asymmetry in boxplots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. What is multicollinearity?**  \n",
    "It occurs when independent variables are highly correlated with each other, which can distort model coefficients and reduce interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What tools do you use for EDA?**  \n",
    "Commonly: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly. For large datasets: Spark or Dask.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Can you explain a time when EDA helped you find a problem?**  \n",
    "(Example) In Titanic data, EDA revealed many missing values in `Cabin`. This insight helps decide whether to drop the column or engineer new features from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. What is the role of visualization in ML?**  \n",
    "Visualization makes patterns clear, highlights anomalies, and helps in communicating insights effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.\n"
